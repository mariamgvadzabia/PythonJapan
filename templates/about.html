                <p>
                    Japan is a land of <strong>"Omotenashi"</strong> — the art of selfless hospitality, and <strong>"Ikigai"</strong> — the search for a reason to wake up every morning. Hidden Japan is dedicated to translating these profound concepts for the modern world. We believe that to truly know Japan, one must understand the balance between the silence of a Zen garden and the chaotic harmony of a Tokyo intersection.
